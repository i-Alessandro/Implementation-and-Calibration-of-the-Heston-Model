# Implementation and Calibration of the Heston Model
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Heston Model, and an example of its calibration using data from the S&P 500 ETF. The model is based on the Carr-Madan pricing method using the Fourier Transform. 

The code is inside the .ipynb, which contains a markdown comment of all the steps taken during the implementation, together with all of the mathematical derivation of the model and the theory behind the calibration of the final model. 

The papers used for the implementation are all linked inside the markdown.
